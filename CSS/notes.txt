**) CSS Cascading and Specificity
<!-- The order of CSS specifity is 
    Universal Selector > Element Selector > Class or Attribute Selector > ID Selector > Inline Selector
-->
*) Cascading = When there are conflicting styles for an HTML element from different sources, the browser follows a set of rules to determine which styles to apply. This process is known as "cascading."



**) CSS Sizing Units
*) em = it gives font size according to its parent for e.g if container has font size 18px then if we give font size:1em to the para inside the container so it have the font size = 18px
So,
(para inside parent font size) 1em = 18px (parent font size)
2em = 36px
*) rem = it gives font size according to the root element (HTML)
(para font size) 1rem = 12px (HTML font size)
2rem = 24px


**) CSS Display Property
*) Display inline = it displays elements in 1 line but it will not give margin or padding from top. it will not give custom width to the element.
*) Display inline-block = it displays elements in 1 line but it will give margin or padding from top and also give custom width to the element
*) Visibility hidden = it remove the element and but keep the space contained by the element
*) Display none = it remove both the element and space contained by the element



**) CSS Position Property
*) Every element has position:static by default.
*) So we use position:relative to give z-index.
*) Postion:absolute set element according to the nearest positioned ancestor. If no parent element has position:relative then it will take HTML tag as reference position because there is no tag above it.
*) **) Exception: Transform, filter, or prespective properties can also make an element appear as positioned.


**) Float aand Clear
*) Display: flow-root used to make float element inside parent div. 
*) float: left will take the div to the left.
*) clear: both will not allow to float another div inside it


**) Flexbox
*) align-items = Used when there is just 1 line of content
*) align-content = Used when there is multiple lines of content


**) Grid
*) Grid Lines = Border lines of cells
*) Grid Cell =  Boxes inside grid
*) Grid Track = Space between 2 grid lines
*) Grid Area = Area between 4 grid cells
*) We can give custom names to the columns and grids. Fro e.g:  grid-template-columns: [pehla] 120px [doosra] 100px [t];
*) fr Unit = It is used in Grid and 1fr = 1 fraction of the total width
*) place-content:center = It applys both align-items:center and justify-content: center.


**) Object fit
*) object-fit:cover;
*) object-position: right bottom; // it is used to set the position of the image inside the container
